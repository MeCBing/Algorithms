    a. Every time I choose the item is the highest price in all items.
    b. like this example best(92, [(8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 12), (5, 6)]) if I choose 12 for all I will got the answer 108 but the best one is 109.
    c. return the best solution in subproblem.
    d. if it has recurrence choose the first one.
    e. if we do not choose we need the 0, and this is the base case.
    f. we use the w to run each weight best case, and each w can put many item; also, the total item is n.
       So, each w and n also need space so the space is n*w.
